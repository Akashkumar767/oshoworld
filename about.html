He was a prolific author and speaker known for his controversial views on spirituality, sexuality, and social norms. He questioned traditional religious beliefs and emphasized individual spiritual experience and self-discovery. His teachings, often delivered through discourses, are collected in numerous books and audio recordings. 
Here's a more detailed look at Osho's life and teachings:
